// You are given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains 
//capital letters A to Z where each letter represents a different task. 
//Tasks could be done without the original order of the array. Each task is 
//done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete 
//either one task or just be idle.

// However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown 
//period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that 
//there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

// You need to return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take 
//to finish all the given tasks.



// Example 1:

// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
// Output: 8
// Explanation: 
// A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
// There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
// Example 2:

// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
// Output: 6
// Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
// ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
// ["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
// ["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
// ...
// And so on.
// Example 3:

// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
// Output: 16
// Explanation: 
// One possible solution is
// A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle
// -> idle -> A


// Constraints:

// The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
// The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

// Concepts: The result value can be calculated by determining the task(s) that 
//occur(s) most often. First let's consider the case where there is just 1 task 
//that occurs most often, in this case, 'B'

// Case 1: [A, B, B, C] n=2
// The shortest solution would be [B, A, C, B]
// Notice how the solution isn't something like [A, B, C, _, B]. We've spaced 
//out the most occuring task (B) as wide as possible in the array, by having it 
//be at the beginning and end.

// Case 2: [A, B, B, C, C] n = 2
// Consider this, where there are multiple tasks that occur most often (B and C). 
//The solution is essentially the same as Case 1, but with both of our max 
//occuring tasks (B, C) spread out as much as possible, at the beginning and end, 
//with the A in the middle.
// Shortest solution: [B, C, A, B, C]

// Case 3: [A, B, C, C, C] n=2
// If we consider the case where the number of occurrences for the max tasks is 
//3, we can see that a pattern shows itself.
// Shortest solution: [C, A, _, C, B, _, C]
// C will always have 2 spaces between it, and we try to fill it in with the 
//other tasks. From this, we can see that the solution is a multiple of the max 
//number of occurences - 1.

// What if n = 3?

// Case 4: [A, B, B, C] n = 3
// For the first example [A, B, B, C], we'll do the same as before by spreading 
//out the most occurring task, but in order to satisfy the n=3 spacing, we will 
//have to put 1 space somewhere in between (it doesn't matter where).
// Solution => [B, A, C, _, B]

// We can start to see a pattern here, and thus, we can create a formula to 
//determine the answer!

// in short, the formula is...
// resultCount = (maxOccurrences - 1) * (n + 1) + (numMaxTasks);

// Let's break this down...

// maxOccurences - 1
// As seen in case 3, we know that we need to multiply times maxOccurences. We 
//must subtract 1 because we dont need to have any empty spaces or filling after 
//the last occurence, at the end.

// (n + 1)
// We need to multiply times n+1 because there will always be n spaces in 
//between, which when multiplying, would not be including the actual task if we 
//were to not add 1.

// +maxNumTasks
// This is to consider the case where there is more than 1 task that needs to be 
//appended at the end, such as in Case 2.

// Edge cases
// It's possible that there is more than enough "filler" tasks to complete.
// Consider [A, B, C, C, D, E, F, G] where n = 2;

// Using our formula, our answer would be 4. Clearly this isn't correct because 
//there are more than 4 tasks in the starting array!
// Thus, we can just return the length of the initial array.
