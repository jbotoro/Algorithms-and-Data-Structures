//Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions 
//surrounded by 'X'.

//A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

//Example:

//X X X X
//X O O X
//X X O X
//X O X X
//After running your function, the board should be:

//X X X X
//X X X X
//X X X X
//X O X X
//Explanation:

//Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the 
//border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border 
//and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two 
//cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or 
//vertically.
